# OpenAI API Key - get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here

# Crossmint API Key - get from https://www.crossmint.com/console
# IMPORTANT: Use a SERVER API KEY (starts with sk_staging_ or sk_production_) for API key signer
#
# Setup steps for API Key Signer (Server-Side Authentication):
# 1. Go to https://www.crossmint.com/console
# 2. Create a new Smart Wallet project (or use existing)
# 3. Navigate to API Keys section
# 4. Create a SERVER API key (starts with sk_staging_ or sk_production_)
# 5. Copy the key and paste below
#
# How it works:
# - Guest wallet is created CLIENT-SIDE with server API key signer
# - No user authentication required
# - Wallet is controlled by the API key
# - Simpler setup than Email OTP approach
#
# Server-side API key for both Guest and Host wallets
CROSSMINT_API_KEY=sk_staging_your-server-key-here

# Vite requires VITE_ prefix to expose to client-side
